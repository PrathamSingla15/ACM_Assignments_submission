* The outer loop iterates from i = 0 to n - 1. The outer loop looks at each number in that list one by one.
 So,it has a time complexity of O(n).
* For each number in the list that the outer loop is looking at, the inner loop checks other numbers in the
list to see if they're smaller than the current number being looked at by the outer loop.
* In the worst-case scenario, for each number the outer loop looks at, the inner loop might have to go 
through almost the entire list to find numbers smaller than the current one.
* This results in a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2).

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the given code is O(n^2) due to nested loop.
